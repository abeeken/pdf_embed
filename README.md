# pdf_embed

A WordPress plugin which uses the PDFJS libraries to enable simple embedding of PDF files from the media library into pages. Very early build with limited functionality and a couple of toggles in the admin to turn on JQuery and Bootstrap which are used in the front end, if your theme doesn't already use them.

Feel free to fork, clone, contribute - all that jazz.
